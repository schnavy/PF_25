Hello, I am David Wahrenburg, an interdisciplinary artist based in Bremen (Germany), with a background in computer science and graphic design.
<br/><br/>
My research-based practice currently revolves around the exploitation of data, human labour, and natural resources in
digital infrastructure and large-scale systems, tracing post-colonial and/or economic and/or political power structures.
