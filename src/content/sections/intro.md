title: "Introduction"
---

I am an interdisciplinary artist, based in Bremen (Germany), with a background in computer science and
graphic design.
<br/><br/>
My research-based practise currently wanders around the exploitation
of data, human labor and natural recourses in digital infrastructure and large scale systems, following traces of
post-colonial and/or
economic and/or political power structures.
