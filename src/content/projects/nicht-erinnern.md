Nicht-erinnnern – not able to remember, diffusing, supposed to forget, not allowed to recognize. An installation about the gap, the blurry part of a dream, of the Internet, media or our brain. It's a game about the limitation of knowledge. On purpose or not. A camera is pointed at the spectator but they only see a pixelated or blurry version of themself.

tube television + face recognition camera
